The website was renewed; it is generated using Zola (an SSG), with a modified `tale-zola` theme, a basic blogging orientated theme.

The site is build using a static site generator (SSG). SSGs are an interesting plaything, allowing customization via a templating system to quite a degree. For me they lack the maintainance and security issues inherent to most (if not all) dynamic CMS-es.

By now there are [loads of SSGs](https://jamstack.org/generators/) around. I found Hugo more forgiving to start out with, and feature-rich, but in the end the stricter and (perhaps) simpler Zola setup was more attractive to me.

To be continued...
