The site theme has been changed to [Abridge](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge/) for Zola. Some graphical details and features are missing, and may be re-added, like the paginator on the post page. As a bonus, Abridge is actively developed and accepting contributions.

- Wide-screen setups get to see an index (or TOC) listings next to the page. 
- The current setup defaults to dark mode, which can be toggled in the top-right corner (with JavaScript enabled; it stores `theme:"light"` in the local browser storage) \
- [Privacy](@/pages/privacy.md) info was added
