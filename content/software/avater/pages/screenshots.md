## Logo

While not yet finalized, the logo depicts an exaggeratedly styled e-reader on top of a pop-art inspired colored background.

It was designed after struggling with WIN32 API USB support over a period of weeks; the use of more psychedelic color combinations (such as pink and purple) was toned down afterwards.
